Thanks for getting in touch, we’re happy to help you all record a video. To help me schedule you into our studio, can you tell me more about when you’d like to come in, how many people will be filming, and if there are any deadlines we should be aware of?

## borrowing gear request
Hi, 

Thanks for getting in touch with the LL! Can you tell me a bit more about what you’re trying to capture / what gear you’d like to borrow and when?

All best,

## returning gear emails
Hi, 

Yes you can definitely swing by the LL to return the gear! We are open 9am-5pm Monday through Friday, so any time during that window works!

All best,

## student group requests
### option 1
Hi,

Thanks so much for reaching out! We mostly only have the capacity to help students in courses we’re supporting, but we do have some limited bandwidth to help out with student projects. Can you let us know more specifically what resources you’re looking for? 
 
All best,
The Learning Lab

### option 1.5
Hi,

Thanks so much for reaching out. The Learning Lab collaborates with professors on specific courses and support plans for their students, so we typically only have the capacity to support students in the courses we are working with. Can you give us more information about your project and the course/professor it’s for? Alternatively, it may be useful to check out Harvard Library’s Tech Loan program: https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/tech-loan.


All best,

Dani


### option 2 
Hi,

We have a limited bandwidth to work with student groups that overlap with our mission. So while we’d probably be unable to collaborate on every video with you, we would love to have you come in for a meeting to talk about your projects and brainstorm which of them we could support and the kind of support we could provide. 

Please let us know if you’d be interested in coming in to discuss, and if there are times that work well for you.

All best,

### option 3 (when we already know we want to help)
Hi,

Thanks so much for reaching out. The Learning Lab collaborates with professors on specific courses and support plans for their students, so we typically only have the capacity to support students in the courses we are working with. Can you give us more information about your project and the course number + name and professor it’s for? 

If you can give us that information, I should be able to book time in our small studio for you if we have availability. Please also let me know some date and time options that would work for you, and how much time you’ll need to record.
 
Thanks so much!

All best,
