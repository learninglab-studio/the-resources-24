# dd-today

## things to do today
* slack to airtable to weekly doc 
* meet about open house?
* create a shared drive for LL_Media

chatting with marlon this morning
- TDM can divide it up - have done 4 shoots so each person could take a shoot (pro res file that is somewhere identifiable or google drive - MPAs could hand off to luke)
- create a pop up studio with a green screen at 125MA - today would be an occassion for them to imagine they were setting that up with these cameras
    - building this system: set up an ATEM and capture photos from it, and get those stills into an airtable (new base in experimental) and then print things out of that airtable
    - ultra studio and ATEM constellation 1ME
    - Jordan and the MPAs to work on 
    - bok open house photo booth and gallery (add to projects)
    - have on the wall a display that leads people into where the party is happening..(P&P may take care of this). if you go in there, you'll make something where you can get added
