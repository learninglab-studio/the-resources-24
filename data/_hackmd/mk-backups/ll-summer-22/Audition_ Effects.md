# Audition: Effects

Audition has a collection of effects available to enhance productions.
##
## Volume Effects
- **Amplify**: Increases or decreases the volume of the audio you have selected.

- **Channel Mixer**: Alters the balance of stereo or surround channels. Enables you to change the apparent position of sounds, correct mismatched levels, and address phasing issues.
- **DeEsser**: Removes sibilance, “ess” sounds. To visually adjust Center Frequency and Bandwidth, drag the edges of the selection in the graph. Multiband is best for most audio content.
- **Dynamics Processing**: A Dynamics multiprocessor. Produces consistent volume levels When used as a compressor or limiter. As an expander, it increases dynamic range by reducing the level of low‑level signals. You can also use this effect as a noise gate by using extreme expander settings to completely eliminate noise below the set threshold.
- **Dynamics Effects**: Multiprocessor that contains an Auto Gate, Compressor, Expander, and Limiter. 
    - **Auto Gate**: Removes noise below a certain amplitude threshold. Useful for removing unwanted background noise like a persistent fan or hum.
    - **Compressor**: Reduces the dynamic range (the difference in level between the loudest and quietest parts of an audio signal)
    - **Expander**: Increases the dynamic range (the difference in level between the loudest and quietest parts of an audio signal). Essentially the opposite of a compressor.
    - **Limiter**: Dynamic range compression used to increase the perceived loudness of an audio recording while preventing clipping.
    
- **Fade Envelope**: Used to reduce amplitude by varying amounts over time. Applies an adjustable amplitude envelope visible in the Waveform Editor panel, click the yellow envelope line to add draggable points. Select the Spline Curves rather than the linear transition option if curved transitions between points are desired.  
-  **Gain Envelope**: Used to boost or reduce amplitude over time. Applies an adjustable amplitude envelope visible in the Waveform Editor panel, click the yellow envelope line to add draggable points. Select the Spline Curves rather than the linear transition option if curved transitions between points are desired.
-  **Hard Limiter**: Dynamic range compression used to increase the perceived loudness of an audio recording while preventing clipping. More aggressive than standard limiting.
-  **Multi-band Compressor**: Compressor with  four independently adjustable frequency bands.
-  **Normalize**: Sets the maximum amplitude of a track. Amplifies the entire audio track equally.
-  **Single-band Compressor**: Reduces sounds that exceed the set threshold level, bringing desired audio into focus and boosting the perceived loudness. This is effective for voiceovers, because it helps the speaker stand out over musical soundtracks and background audio.
-  **Speech Volume Leveler**:  Compressor optimizing dialogue while removing background noise.
-  **Tube-modeled Compressor**: Compressor simulating the warmth (subtle distortion) of vintage hardware compressors.
