### Album Cover

A collection of [Cool Album Covers](https://hackmd.io/rSX9fu8wSdODJMHMeY7-mw) by the LLUFS!

Size: 1080 x 1080

At first I tried mimicking this album cover:
![](https://i.imgur.com/MwoTqjH.png =500x)

![](https://i.imgur.com/fdPYTrG.jpg =500x)

But I really didn't like the vibe.

Maybe something like this?

![](https://i.imgur.com/DNbs4DH.png =500x)

Although it might be hard to get a close up of my eye.

I really loved this one!

Mask Practice

Helpful commands:
Command + T to select stuff
Resize before doing mask because idk how to change mask size!!!
How to color correct the green off of me?
Maybe cycling through flowers in a gif? Maybe multiple victorias? Ask Juan how to do the painting thing he did for his album cover.

Quick Mask vs Select Subject?

### Kuleshov Effect

 The Kuleshov Effect two sequantial shots have more impact than a single shot.

    sequential shots interact/juxtapose.
       
    can manipulate time, space, reaction.
    
![image alt](https://nofilmschool.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_wide/public/kuleshoveffect.png?itok=cqbd2HMl =500x)
    
Meaning is created from the juxtaposition of individual shots.

For example, eye line shots. More emotional than factual of what the human eye can see/do.

Zooming in for instance, implies significance.

Meaning is created from these two shots. Shot B is what the character sees in Shot A. Shot B gives emotion to Shot A

The more cartooned something is, "the easier it is to accept discontinutities or unrealities."
