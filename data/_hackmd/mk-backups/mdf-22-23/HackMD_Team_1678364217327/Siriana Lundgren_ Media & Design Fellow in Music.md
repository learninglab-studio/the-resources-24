## Course Support

### Music 160R: Proseminar Composition: Working with Words

Siriana developed and led a film editing for composers workshops for Music 160R students, instructing them in a range of tools that enable composers to create score-following videos. Siriana also had attendees analyze the form of the score following video, thinking through questions related to audience, purpose, and genre. Because many composers use video for other purposes (i.e., portfolios, self-promotion), this workshop also covered some of the basics of video editing.

### Music 97: Sophomore Tutorial

To support students making podcasts in Music 97, Siriana led a workshop about this popular media form. Siriana began the workshop by encouraging students to reflect on the form, doing a close-listening exercise of a popular podcast episode that asked students to reflect on the functional roles that the different components of the podcast played. Then, Siriana led students through a tutorial in an open-source audio editing tool, helping them engage with the technical aspect of making a podcast before they embarked on making their projects on their own. Siriana also had students learn about the different audio qualities of a range of microphones through a "microphone taste test," where students try out different microphones and reflect on their distinct sounds and affordances.

### Music 250HFA: Colloquium on Teaching Pedagogy

Siriana led a digital tools workshop for graduate students. She led them in a discussion of digital pedagogy, including how to design alternative assignments using different media. Workshop participants brainstormed different assignment ideas for the field, thinking intentionally about the specific learning objectives they have for Music students. Siriana also led participants on a tour of some of the tools they might use in workshops and course assignments.

### GENED 1080: How Music Works: Engineering the Acoustical World

Siriana interviewed students about their final projects for Engineering in the Acoustical world, encouraging them to reflect on the instruments they designed in the showcase event this course holds at the end of the term. Siriana and the Learning Lab team used microphones and cameras to capture the students at the event. 

## Department Support

### Creative Projects in Music Workshop

Supporting students from Freshman Seminar 30M: California in the 60s and Music 159R: Analyzing Pop Music, Siriana and Chris Benham hosted a creative projects workshop. Students from any Music course with a creative project option could come to learn more about multimedia forms, including podcasts and video essays. Siriana and Chris led students through an analysis of podcasts and video essays before transitioning to an activity where students had a chance to learn about microphones, video editing, and sound editing. The students also received feedback from the Media & Design Fellows about their specific project ideas. Siriana instructed students in an open-source audio editing tool, Audacity.

## Learning Lab Training

Media & Design Fellows identify key tools they need to learn in order to complete their projects. They join internal labs to receive training and practice using these tools. They also shadow experienced MDFs and Learning Lab staff as they design prompts and lead workshops. 

Siriana has learned 3D modeling tools like Blender and game engine tools like Unity, developing assets that could be used in a variety of pedagogical contexts. Siriana designed a 3D annotated map of a red light district that she studies in her dissertation research. With other MDFs, Siriana also led a tutorial in Unity, an industry-standard game engine. Siriana led students through the basics of this complicated tool, helping them to navigate the interface and imagine the possibilities for game and 3D asset design.
