## Outline of Workshop
* Emily leads discussion on the poster as a form of scicomm, especially noting the ways in which posters communicate science differently than PowerPoint slides (5 min)
    * use example posters to help inspire ideas (focus on one to unpack)
* Students spend time considering the macrostructure and interrelationships within the research story of their poster (10-15 min)
    * write/draw out the written  components of their science story on cards 
    * lay the cards on top of a large sheet of paper and draw arrows between components that are related to each other 
    * rearrange and resize components to be in a logical and effective arrangment
    * think about where written comp. can be made graphical
* Students work on editing the digital drafts of their posters (30 min)
