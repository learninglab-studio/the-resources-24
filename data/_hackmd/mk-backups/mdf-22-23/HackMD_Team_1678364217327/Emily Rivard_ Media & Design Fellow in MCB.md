## Course Support

### SCRB 111: Regeneration: Phenomena to Mechanisms
This semester, Emily assisted SCRB 111 students doing an assignment where they create videos accessible to a broad audience on popular topics in stem cell and regenerative biology. To prepare students for this assignment, Emily assisted at a workshop on visual communication in the sciences.  Emily helped students think about conveying information graphically while simultaneously helping them to get to know each other with an activity in which students plotted themselves on a graph with different personality characteristics on each axis.  The students then created visual representations of different figures from a paper they had read and presented to the class using an overhead camera. 

### SCRB 111 Student Consultations
Later in the semester, Emily and a Learning Lab staff member hosted office hours to assist students prepare visuals for their video assignments.  These videos consisted of voice over narration accompanying visuals they presented under an overhead camera. In office hours, Emily helped students consider how to make visuals that clarified complicated concepts in the text of the narration in a simple, engaging, and constructive way.

### NEURO 101: Neurobiology of Emotion and Mood Disorders

Emily helped facilitate a workshop for students developing their scientific communication skills. In the session, students discussed how to utilize visual content to help increase audience understanding and to convey concepts in a different format than writing, which can be challenging to parse. Scientific communication skills like these are highly relevant to the courseâ€™s objectives, which are to teach students how to read primary literature and to share what they have learned with a broad audience through multimedia presentations.

## Learning Lab Training

Media & Design Fellows identify key tools they need to learn in order to complete their projects. They join internal labs to receive training and practice using these tools. They also shadow experienced MDFs and Learning Lab staff as they design prompts and lead workshops. 

Emily has docked with audio/visual lab, producing an explainer video prototype about a scientific concept that students might make for a course. Emily used simple animations and open-source media. Emily also planned and ran a designLab in which students created explainer videos that addressed different audiences and relied on different modes of communication. Emily has learned video editing in iMovie and Final Cut Pro, animations in Keynote, and recording using the cameras in the Learning Lab.
