Queenie helped Professor Michael Puett optimize the course website for GENED 1091, namely creating a view that displays students' final creative projects. This helps current and future students in two key ways: first, it allows current students to learn from past students' projects, enabling them to see the range of creative possibilities and outcomes; second, it allows future students to refer back to the work they did in the course and, because Queenie has asked students to write reflections on their work in the course, it allows these students to do important metacognitive reflection on their projects. Queenie also created a course roadmap syllabus, held office hours to consult with students as they worked on their final creative projects, and created individual student webpages to host their projects. Queenie also helped Professor Puett with course strategies in terms of how to motivate and inspire students with their creative projects.
