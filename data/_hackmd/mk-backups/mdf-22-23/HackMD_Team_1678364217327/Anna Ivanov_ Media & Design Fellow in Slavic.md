## Course Support

### Slavic 118: Reading Tolstoy's War and Peace
For the students in Slavic 118: Reading Tolstoy’s War and Peace, Anna led two workshops showcasing a variety of creative final project options. Based on student interests, the group talked about podcasting and did an activity listening to Serial, analyzing elements of podcasts, and speaking into a microphone over a music bed. We talked about nontraditional essay formats, looking at video essays, ArcGIS Storymaps, Canva, TimelineJS, and how we would use such tools. Then, we looked at art-making and going beyond the essay. Anna and the students talked through the basics of lighting and film and had students discuss the effects of lighting choices as they sat in front of the cameras and adjusted lighting or focus. At the end, the group talked through the motivations for creative final projects, the best ways to communicate and develop their ideas, and the ideas that they’d been forming. Anna also shared information about our drop-in office hours and Anna's own media office hours (described in more detail below).

### Slavic 193: Introduction to Russian and Soviet Film

At this workshop, Anna had students engage with different aspects of filmmaking, specifically with Soviet film techniques and form in mind. 

At the first station, students worked on stop-motion animations as a team. They were encouraged to think of a very simple plot and to implement it using small figurines, customizable backgrounds, and the in-studio green screen. Students reflected upon the amount of labor and planning involved, and how it would have been different over a century ago.

The second station was focused around cinematic effects. Students discussed how early Soviet cinema was affected by the possibilities of film at the time, and how the tools and techniques lead to interesting developments in both form and content, especially in terms of kinotriuki, or cinematic effects. To think through this, and to explore the possibilities of doing an “updated” Soviet-cinematic final project, students made TikToks that used the language and dynamics of the platform.

They reflected on how making these TikToks made them consider and reconsider the constraints and possibilities allowed by Russian and Soviet cinema in the period they were learning about. Using the in-studio cameras, students also made their own shots inspired by the famous kino-glaz shot from Vertov’s Man with a Movie Camera and the Kuleshov effect.

In the third station, students focused on performing and presenting film analysis. They looked at film strips from The Extraordinary Adventures of Mr. West in the Land of the Bolsheviks and discussed frame-by-frame analysis as a way of dissecting scenes and analyzing film. Then, they learned about and practiced making multimedia essays about film.

## Department Support

### media office hours
In support of students working on creative projects in a range of different media forms, Anna held weekly media office hours at the Learning Lab, providing students with extensive feedback and technical support as they worked on their projects. Anna consulted with students making podcasts, video essays, interactive presentations, among other forms, helping students think intentionally about the form and content of their creative projects. 

### teaching resources for graduate students
Anna has also helped Slavic develop an online repository of teaching resources for graduate students, and she has also helped department faculty with course websites. 

## Learning Lab Training

Media & Design Fellows identify key tools they need to learn in order to complete their projects. They join internal labs to receive training and practice using these tools. They also shadow experienced MDFs and Learning Lab staff as they design prompts and lead workshops. 

Anna developed prototypes and workshops in web-based interactive essays as she learned with other MDFs about scrollytelling, a form used by publications like the New York Times. Anna helped design and facilitate a workshop for students in interactive close-reading and visual analysis, deploying the moves of web-based interactive storytelling (i.e., isolating, re-arranging, redacting, highlighting) as they analyzed a series of texts and images. 

This working group discovered that tools like arcGIS could be useful not only for the presentation of academic/intellectual insights, but also for guiding the process of arriving at those insights.  The group started to develop a list of "intellectual moves," or ways of interacting with images and/or textual excerpts, that can guide students' analyses and syntheses of primary or secondary source materials.
