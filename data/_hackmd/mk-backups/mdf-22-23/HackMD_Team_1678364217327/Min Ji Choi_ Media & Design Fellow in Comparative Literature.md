### Media Office Hours for GENED 1144: Mental Health and Mental Illness Through Literature and the Arts

In support of students' final projects for Mental Health and Mental Illness Through Literature and the Arts, Min Ji hosted media office hours at the Learning Lab. These media office hours are an important way for students to get support as they work in media that might be new to them. And with the Media & Design Fellow's guidance, they can think through the affordances of the media they're using and get assistance with more technical questions as well. Min Ji advised students creating podcasts and working in audio editing tools like Adobe Audition.

### Multimedia Pedagogy for Critical Reading and Teaching/Presenting with Media Graduate Student Workshops

Min Ji has been developing a two-part workshop series for graduate students in Comp Lit on the topics of critical reading and teaching and presenting--both of which will focus on the use of media to enrich these practices.

Media & Design Fellows identify key tools they need to learn in order to complete their projects. They join internal labs to receive training and practice using these tools. They also shadow experienced MDFs and Learning Lab staff as they design prompts and lead workshops. 

Min Ji learned with other MDFs about scrollytelling, a form used by publications like the New York Times. Min Ji helped design and facilitate a workshop for students in interactive close-reading and visual analysis, deploying the moves of web-based interactive storytelling (i.e., isolating, re-arranging, redacting, highlighting) as they analyzed a series of texts and images. 

This working group discovered that tools like arcGIS could be useful not only for the presentation of academic/intellectual insights, but also for guiding the process of arriving at those insights.  The group started to develop a list of "intellectual moves," or ways of interacting with images and/or textual excerpts, that can guide students' analyses and syntheses of primary or secondary source materials.
