Casey, Christine, and Jinyoung
## key details
**When:** Friday, March 17, 10:00 AM – 12:00 PM
**Where:** 12 Oxford Street, 3rd floor
**What:** Jinyoung's lab
**Point of contact:** Jinyoung

## logistics
Jinyoung will meet LL team in the main entrance of 12 Oxford Street and walk everyone up.

## equipment 


## shot list
### ideas:
* Walking up to the lab, shooting the chemistry building
* Two different shoots in the lab
    * Typical chemistry experimenting
    * One that’s specific to A/C research

### mk notes
* has some things he’ll share
* shoot in the lab. some scary looking equipment that tells the story (sounds a little Twister-like)
* show a raw version of how research is done
* reminds you of cell membranes
* random inspiration he collects
* slides now
    * summer
    * AC
    * problem with AC is this molecule
    * so gas to solid
    * show solid structure
        * when you squeeze it gets hot
        * when you release it gets cold
        * pressure and temperature related
    * the molecule
        * template hosts each chain well
        * cooling: ordered
        * heated: disordered, twisted, wiggle
    * shows experiment
        * pressurize it 
    * then tweaks the structure
        * synthetic chemistry
        * that’s what we are good at as chemists
    * side by side
        * data
        * visualization
* let’s try for a montage of similar-looking-structures
