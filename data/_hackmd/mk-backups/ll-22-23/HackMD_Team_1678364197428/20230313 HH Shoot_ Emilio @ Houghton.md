    * enter the building through the back door (see map on p. 2 of the schedule above).  "It's important for all of you—Casey, Christine, Emilio—to enter and exit together, and to stick with Anny when you move through the building."

## shot list
### ideas:
* establish him headed in to library (just in case)
* establish him in the room
* loads and loads and loads of closeups of books
* cut together with shots of Emilio looking at the books
    * we may need to go through a number of different books to make sure that we walk away with the content he needs, and while we're there we may also want to get
* some bird's eye perfect high res shots of the pages themselves for later use in graphics
